Project description:
Modify a game engine and extend its capabilities to include several additional
features, including sound and an "endgame"

The easiest part of this project:
Adding sound, since Dr. Malloy's code was so compatible with his framework.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Picking the right sound effects. The music took me a few hours to settle on
and I'm still not completely satisfied with the sounds I have picked, but
will be speaking with a friend later on to see what can be done.

Additional notes:
The game begins in "demo" mode, with collision turned off. The player can learn
to move, shoot, and avoid overheating without fear of death. To start the game,
press "r".
The game does not have a "win" state, only an "end" state. When the player
dies, they are given the opportunity to either quit with their score or halve
it and keep going. Players choose when they are done, usually once they believe
that no matter their skill they won't be able to top the score they have upon
death.
Because of this, an invincibility mode isn't needed to "complete" the game, but
if you'd like to use one, set <debug> to true in the xml file and press "I" to
toggle 7 seconds of invincibility.
This game is compatible with a wired xbox 360 controller!
